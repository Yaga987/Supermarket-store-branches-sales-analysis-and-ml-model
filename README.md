In this project I use different ml model regression and 2 different scaler and results are very satisfying.
For results I use R2 score and Mean Absolute Error. For visualization I use autoviz library because it is easy to visualize without any matplotlib or seaborn knowledge.
For decomposition use PCA, TruncatedSVD library.
Regression model which  are used in this ML project = 'SVR,LinearSVR,KNeighborsRegressor,DecisionTreeRegressor,DecisionTreeRegressor'
